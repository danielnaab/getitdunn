    <h1>About Us</h1>

<p><strong>Mind Over Matter (M.O.M.) Inc.</strong>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is the presenter of the Get It Dunn 5K/Half Marathon. </p>

<p>M.O.M. was created by life-long friends Karen Hatfield McCalla and Janelle Jordan in 2009. Karen had recently lost her mother, Kathleen Fisher, to cancer. After the passing of Fisher, Janelle and Karen wanted to find a way to keep the vivacious spirit of Fisher alive through a community organization. The two founded M.O.M. to encourage people to reach their personal fitness goals, while giving back to our communities.</p>

<h2><strong>M.O.M. mission: To encourage personal wellness and community betterment — enabling people to help others while helping themselves.</strong></h2>

<p>Following in Kathleen&#39;s motto of &quot;work hard, play harder,&quot; M.O.M. evolved with the support of family, friends, volunteers and sponsors and in 2012 the Get It Dunn 5K &amp; half marathon was born. </p>

<p><strong>The success of the Get It Dunn 5K &amp; 1/2 Marathon has funded over $100,000 in M.O.M.&#39;s charitable giving initiatives,</strong> including Summer Camperships, scholarships, needs-based and holiday gift initiatives.</p>

<h1>M.O.M.&#39;s Giving</h1>

<h3>Summer Camperships</h3>

<p>Could you use some assistance to help your child attend a summer camp, league, class or activity? M.O.M. Summer Camperships are awarded annually in the spring. <strong>This gift, much like our other scholarships, is geared towards those that need financial assistance to enable a child to participate. We ask that you please keep this in mind when applying. </strong>Each April we randomly choose recipients from the following three school grade groups: K–5, 6–9 &amp; 10–12. Maximum awards are $250/individual and $400/family to qualifying applicants. Checks will be made out directly to the camp/league etc. Winners will be also awarded a free registration to the Get It Dunn 5k.</p>

<h1>Brooke Richartz Foundation, Inc.</h1>

<p>The Brooke Richartz Foundation, Inc. is being established to carry out the vision outlined by Brooke Richartz who passed away in 2022 from ovarian cancer. Throughout her life, Brooke acted as a mentor for students of all ages and professionals.  She saw a need as she was volunteering in schools for students to obtain the tools, mentors and resources necessary to develop plans to reach their career goals including, but not limited to the avenues the student should take to obtain the career they are seeking. To that end, Brooke prior to her passing asked that a foundation be created to assist students with career planning as well as help youth and families who are dealing with a family member with cancer. Brooke&#39;s motto, was &quot;Do your best and have fun&quot;.  Brooke lived up to that motto and her foundation supports her philosophy so others can do their best and have fun while trying to reach their goals. Stay tuned to learn more about Brooke&#39;s foundation, and it will partner with the  Get It Dunn event.</p>
